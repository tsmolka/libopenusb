All ioctl() calls are unavailable when the usbfs file is opened read-only
(which is necessary for most non-root users).

Some ioctl() calls are only available to root (uid 0) even when opened
read-write (user has write privs), such as IOCTL_USB_HUB_PORTINFO
(anything that uses IOCTL_USB_IOCTL).

Different kernels will byte swap values in the cached descriptors
differently. We need to be smarter about this. Perhaps parse it out
of /proc/bus/usb/devices as well to detect the endianess?
