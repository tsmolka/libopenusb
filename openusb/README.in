General Information
===================

Openusb is an enhanced version of the libusb 0.1.* library which allows
userspace application access to USB devices. Documents can be found in
the project's website.

The official web site is:
  http://openusb.sourceforge.net/

Installation
============
If you run "make install", the binaries will be installed to default path
- /usr/local/lib. You may change this default path to a desired one with
--prefix=path when running ./configure.
If openusb backend is not in default path, use "OPENUSB_BACKEND_PATH"
environment variable to specify the path of *.so to the install path or
to the compile output path which should be under the src/.libs directory.

How to report bugs
==================

To report a bug, visit http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/openusb/ and fill
out a bug report form.

Please make sure to include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testopenusb program that is built 
  in the openusb/ directory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

Patches
=======

Patches can be sent to openusb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.

If the patch fixes a bug, it is usually a good idea to include
all the information described in "How to Report Bugs".

Building
========

It should be as simple as running these two commands:

./autogen.sh
make

You may need to install additional software to build the code on some systems.
For example, automake and libtool are required for Solaris. 

FIXME: Note about building documentation

Building documentation may fail. To eliminate the error messages, please compile by:
./autogen.sh --disable-build-docs
